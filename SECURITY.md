# Security

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Langford Log application.

## Authentication

**Firebase Authentication**
- Email/password authentication
- Authorized email list for account creation
- Password complexity requirements
- Input validation and sanitization

**Access Control**
- Only authorized emails can create accounts
- All operations require authentication

## Data Security

**Firestore Rules**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /foremen/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /employees/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

**Data Protection**
- Authenticated access only
- No public data access
- Input validation on client and server
- Secure session management

## API Security

**Backend Measures**
- CORS configuration
- Server-side input validation
- File upload limits and type restrictions
- Secure error handling
- Environment variables for sensitive data

**Email Security**
- Gmail SMTP with app passwords
- Secure credential storage
- User attribution in logs

## Client Security

**Input Validation**
- Email format validation
- Password complexity enforcement
- Input sanitization
- XSS prevention through React

**UI Security**
- Loading states prevent multiple submissions
- Masked password fields
- Disabled auto-complete for sensitive fields

## Network Security

**Communication**
- HTTPS with SSL certificates
- Encrypted Firebase communication
- Secure API endpoints

**File Handling**
- Image files only
- File size and count limits
- Temporary storage with automatic cleanup

## Environment

**Configuration**
- Environment variables for all secrets
- No hardcoded credentials
- Secure cloud deployment on Render
- Production environment isolation

## Monitoring

**Logging**
- Authentication attempts
- API access with user attribution
- Error logging for security events
- Email delivery status

**Response**
- Failed login monitoring
- Firebase rate limiting
- Account security measures
- Regular security updates
